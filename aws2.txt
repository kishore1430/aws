Types of Cloud Business/Service Models
=======================================
We have three types of cloud service models.

1) IaS - Infrastructure as a service 

2) PaS - Platform as a service 

3) SaS - Software as a service 

All cloud providers deal with three service models.

All comes up and ends up with shared responsibilities.

Some group of expertise engineers will decide which business model is good for their organization.

Importance of linux
===================

Q) Who was the richest person for a long period of time ?

   Bill Gates (It is because windows licensing model)



Linus Torvalds is a man behind the linux OS.

He thought, to run operating system why should I buy hardware from you and why have to pay for licencing to it.By keeping these aspects in mind he created an Operating system which is free for every one and everyone should have capability to access code of it. 

He started an open source project called linux (linux kernel).

kernel is a first layer of the OS.

Every OS is having it's own kernel.
ex:
	Linux kernel : it is a piece of software which interacts with hardware.
		> He wants to make a free CLI OS
		> Should run on any hardware
		> OS should be open source
		> GNUX (Generally Not Unix)
	
There are 300+ flavours / Distributions in linux(vendors).

All the 300+ operating system are clone either from "RedHat OS" or "Debian".
