Linux provides two ways authentication.

1) username and password (recommanded)

2) username with key (Not recommanded but good for learning)

----------------------------------------
Key based authentation contains two files.

1) public key 

2) private key 

To deal with SSH mechanism we need to install putty in our computer (windows user).
